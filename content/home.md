This course encompasses everything I've learned about building with AI (or vibe coding) on Replit through project-based, hands on material.

The course will be mostly video, with supplementary written content.

Everything lesson will revolve around creating _real_ applications, including the logic and skills necessary to get you there.

If you complete the course, you'll get a nifty certificate.

## Course structure

We'll cover the following topics:

[ TOPICS ]

Through project-based, hands on work. 

## Outcomes

By the end of this course you will be able to:

## Requirements

You should be able to complete the first few lessons for free, to get started you'll need:

- A Replit account
- 30 minutes

To complete the course successfully, you'll need

- A Replit Core subscription (you will likely hit usage limits)
- Several hours

You **do not** need to know how to code to complete this course. I want to emphasize that. I find the following traits characteristic of successful vibe coders:

- The willingness to tinker
- The courage to fail and try again
- Logical thinking
- Patience
- Agency

A good example is spreadsheetsâ€”if you've ever built out something even remotely complicated in a spreadsheet, you can succeed at vibe coding.
