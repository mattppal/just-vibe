# Introduction

Welcome to our documentation site. Learn everything you need to know to get started quickly.

## What is this?

This documentation covers everything you need to know to use our platform efficiently. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced user, you'll find all the information you need to get started and make the most of our features.

Our platform is designed to be intuitive and powerful, allowing you to build complex applications without the complexity typically associated with such tasks.

## Key Features

- Easy to understand architecture with minimal boilerplate
- Excellent performance through optimized static generation
- Comprehensive tooling for development workflows
- Flexible configuration options for customization
- Built-in security features and best practices

## Code Example

Here's a simple example of how to use our main API:

```javascript
import { createApp } from '@platform/core';

// Initialize the application
const app = createApp({
  name: 'my-awesome-app',
  version: '1.0.0',
  config: {
    staticGeneration: true,
    optimizeAssets: true
  }
});

// Register routes
app.route('/', {
  get(req, res) {
    return res.render('home', {
      title: 'Welcome to My App'
    });
  }
});

// Start the application
app.start();
```

The example above demonstrates the basic structure of an application using our platform. You can easily extend this with more routes, components, and features.
