Hi, I'm Matt ðŸ‘‹

I work in Developer Relations at Replit. This course will be everything you need to get started vibe coding and quite a bit more.

I've found most material out there is relatively shallow, so I wanted to create something in-depth for you all to engage with. I believe that _anyone_ can create

As a testament to that fact, I built this entire course site and deployed it in two days. It features:

- Authentication for course tracking & completion
- Custom markdown rendering
- User management and internal analytics
- Certificate generation

Most of the content will require you to create an account & login. You can do that by clicking the login button in the top left. 

You'll be using something called "Replit Auth," to login, which we'll discuss in the course. Replit Auth uses Replit's infrastructure to securely create an account for you.

You won't be subscribed to marketing emails or communications. The reason I added login is:

1. So you can see the power of vibe coded apps,
2. So you can keep track of lessons you've completed. 

Once you login, you'll be able to see the locked lessons in the sidebar.
