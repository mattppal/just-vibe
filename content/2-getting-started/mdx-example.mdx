# MDX Example

This documentation page demonstrates the MDX features available in our documentation platform.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that combines Markdown with JSX (JavaScript XML) syntax. It allows you to use React components directly in your Markdown content.

## Importing Components

You can import and use React components in your MDX files:

```jsx
import { Button } from 'some-ui-library';

<Button variant="primary">Click me!</Button>
```

## Code Blocks

MDX supports syntax highlighting just like regular Markdown:

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log('Hello, MDX!');
}
```

## MDX Syntax

MDX allows you to write JSX directly in your markdown files.

## Conclusion

MDX provides powerful capabilities for creating rich, interactive documentation. Use it whenever you need to go beyond what regular Markdown offers.
