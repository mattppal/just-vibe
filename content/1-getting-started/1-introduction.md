# Welcome to the Documentation

This is the introduction page of our documentation site. This page is publicly accessible to everyone, even if they're not logged in.

## Public vs. Protected Content

In this documentation site:

- Public pages (like this one) have `authenticated: false` in their frontmatter
- Protected pages require authentication to view
- Protected pages appear greyed out with a ðŸ”’ lock icon in the sidebar

## Getting Started

To get started with our platform, browse through the documentation sections in the sidebar. If you encounter locked content, you'll need to log in to view it.

## Test Code Block

```javascript
// This is a test code block to verify syntax highlighting
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('User'));
```
