### [Link to this section](https://mdxjs.com/packages/remark-mdx/\#what-is-this) What is this?

This package is a [unified](https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified) ( [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark)) plugin to enable the extensions to markdown that MDX adds: JSX ( `<x/>`), export/import ( `export x from 'y'`), and expression { `{1 + 1}`}. You can use this plugin to add support for parsing and serializing them.

This plugin does not handle how MDX is compiled to JavaScript or evaluated and rendered to HTML. That’s done by [`@mdx-js/mdx`](https://mdxjs.com/packages/mdx/).

### [Link to this section](https://mdxjs.com/packages/remark-mdx/\#when-should-i-use-this) When should I use this?

This plugin is useful if you’re dealing with the MDX syntax and integrating with remark, rehype, and the rest of unified. Some example use cases are when you want to lint the syntax or compile it to something other that JavaScript.

If you don’t use plugins and want to access the syntax tree, you can use [`mdast-util-from-markdown`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast-util-from-markdown) with [`mdast-util-mdx`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast-util-mdx).

Typically though, you’d want to move a layer up: `@mdx-js/mdx`. That package is the core compiler for turning MDX into JavaScript which gives you the most control. Or even higher: if you’re using a bundler (Rollup, esbuild, webpack), or a site builder (Next.js) or build system (Vite) which comes with a bundler, you’re better off using an integration: see [§ Integrations](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/#integrations).

### [Link to this section](https://mdxjs.com/packages/remark-mdx/\#install) Install

</script>

```

Copy

### [Link to this section](https://mdxjs.com/packages/remark-mdx/\#use) Use

TypeScript

```tsx
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkMdx from 'remark-mdx'

const file = await remark()
  .use(remarkMdx)
  .process('import a from "b"\n\na <b /> c {1 + 1} d')

console.log(String(file))

### [Link to this section](https://mdxjs.com/packages/remark-mdx/\#api) API

This package exports no identifiers. The default export is [`remarkMdx`](https://mdxjs.com/packages/remark-mdx/#unifieduseremarkmdx-options).

#### [Link to this section](https://mdxjs.com/packages/remark-mdx/\#unifieduseremarkmdx-options)`unified().use(remarkMdx[, options])`

Add support for MDX (JSX: `<Video id={123} />`, export/imports: `export {x} from 'y'`; and expressions: `{1 + 1}`).

###### [Link to this section](https://mdxjs.com/packages/remark-mdx/\#parameters) Parameters

- `options` ( [`Options`](https://mdxjs.com/packages/remark-mdx/#options), optional) — configuration

###### [Link to this section](https://mdxjs.com/packages/remark-mdx/\#returns) Returns

Nothing ( `undefined`).

#### [Link to this section](https://mdxjs.com/packages/remark-mdx/\#options)`Options`

Configuration (TypeScript type).

###### [Link to this section](https://mdxjs.com/packages/remark-mdx/\#fields) Fields

- `acornOptions` ( [`AcornOptions`](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn/blob/520547b/acorn/src/acorn.d.ts#L578), default: `{ecmaVersion: 2024, locations: true, sourceType: 'module'}`) — configuration for acorn; all fields except `locations` can be set
- `printWidth` ( `number`, default: `Infinity`) — try and wrap syntax at this width; when set to a finite number (say, `80`), the formatter will print attributes on separate lines when a tag doesn’t fit on one line; the normal behavior is to print attributes with spaces between them instead of line endings
- `quote` ( `'"'` or `"'"`, default: `'"'`) — preferred quote to use around attribute values
- `quoteSmart` ( `boolean`, default: `false`) — use the other quote if that results in less bytes
- `tightSelfClosing` ( `boolean`, default: `false`) — do not use an extra space when closing self-closing elements: `<img/>` instead of `<img />`

For recommendations on how to author MDX, see each corresponding readme:

- [ESM](https://github.com/micromark/micromark-extension-mdxjs-esm#authoring)
- [JSX](https://github.com/micromark/micromark-extension-mdx-jsx#authoring)
- [expressions](https://github.com/micromark/micromark-extension-mdx-expression/tree/main/packages/micromark-extension-mdx-expression#authoring)
- [CommonMark features not in MDX](https://github.com/micromark/micromark-extension-mdx-md#authoring)

### [Link to this section](https://mdxjs.com/packages/remark-mdx/\#html) HTML

MDX has no representation in HTML. Though, when you are dealing with MDX, you will likely go _through_ hast. You can enable passing MDX through to hast by configuring [`remark-rehype`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-rehype) with `passThrough: ['mdxjsEsm', 'mdxFlowExpression', 'mdxJsxFlowElement', 'mdxJsxTextElement', 'mdxTextExpression']`.

### [Link to this section](https://mdxjs.com/packages/remark-mdx/\#types) Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). It exports the additional type [`Options`](https://mdxjs.com/packages/remark-mdx/#options).

If you’re working with the syntax tree, you can register the new node types with `@types/mdast` by adding a reference:

TypeScript

```tsx
// Register MDX nodes in mdast:
/// <reference types="remark-mdx" />

/**
 * @import {Root} from 'mdast'
 */

import {visit} from 'unist-util-visit'

function myRemarkPlugin() {
  /**
   * @param {Root} tree
   *   Tree.
   * @returns {undefined}
   *   Nothing.
   */
  return function (tree) {
    visit(tree, function (node) {
      console.log(node) // `node` can now be one of the MDX nodes.
    })
  }
}

```

Copy

### [Link to this section](https://mdxjs.com/packages/remark-mdx/\#compatibility) Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of Node. This means we try to keep the current release line, `remark-mdx@^3`, compatible with Node.js 16.
